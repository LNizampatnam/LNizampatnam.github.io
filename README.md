My name is Lakshmi Nizampatnam, and I am in Aerospace industry. As mentioned in my intro video, I have been in the industry for 20+ years, with 15 years of managerial experience, including as an executive.   
I was born and raised in India. Came to the US for my master's and eventually I received a PhD in Aerospace Engineering. I am a US citizen now.    
I also received an MBA from the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University.  

I previously lived and worked in Japan. Managed cross-functional teams spread across the world.
I am looking forward to polish my skills with the Fullstack Development with MERN, and understand more about the IT indistry!
